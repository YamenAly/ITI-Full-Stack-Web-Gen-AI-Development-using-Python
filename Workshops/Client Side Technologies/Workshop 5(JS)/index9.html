<!-- 6.2 - receive an array of numbers from user it's size will determined from user , 
then receive it and make sure all values is Number
then ask user to enter one of the following letter
a : to display array with the same receiving order
b : to display array with ascending order
c : to display array with descending order
d : to reversed version of original array 
e : to display even numbers only from array if there no even numbers , display alert to
inform user with that

f : receive number from user then display all numbers from array which divisible by 
received number , if there no result inform user with that
g : display new array with 30% discount for all numbers in original array
h : display string which represent all numbers of array concated with ***

after each selected choice you have to ask user if he | she want to repeate running -->
